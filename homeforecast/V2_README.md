- **Time Range**: Minimum 1 week, ideally 1+ years
- **Variables**: Temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Building Physics Extraction

The IDF parser extracts these thermal characteristics:

```python
# Thermal Properties
thermal_mass_J_per_K        # Building thermal capacitance
average_r_value_m2K_per_W   # Thermal resistance
thermal_time_constant_hours # RC time constant

# RC Model Parameters  
a_parameter                 # 1/œÑ (inverse time constant)
heating_rate_F_per_hr      # HVAC heating capacity
cooling_rate_F_per_hr      # HVAC cooling capacity
solar_gain_factor          # Solar heat gain coefficient
```

### Physics Validation

All training data undergoes strict physics validation:

- **Temperature Differential**: Heat flows hot ‚Üí cold
- **HVAC Constraints**: Heating adds heat, cooling removes heat
- **Rate Limits**: Maximum 10¬∞F/hr temperature change
- **Continuity**: Smooth temperature transitions

### API Endpoints

v2.0 adds these new REST API endpoints:

```http
POST /api/v2/building-model/upload    # Upload IDF file
POST /api/v2/weather-dataset/upload   # Upload EPW file  
POST /api/v2/training/run             # Run enhanced training
GET  /api/v2/model/status             # Get v2.0 system status
```

## üî¨ Advanced Configuration

### Custom Training Parameters

```javascript
// Enhanced training configuration
{
  "training_duration_hours": 168,           // 1 week
  "hvac_scenarios": [                       // Scenarios to simulate
    "heating", "cooling", "off", "mixed"
  ],
  "physics_validation": true,               // Enable physics checks
  "adaptive_learning": true,                // Use adaptive learning rates
  "ml_correction": false                    // Disable ML correction (v2.0)
}
```

### Building Model Customization

Advanced users can modify extracted parameters:

```python
# Override RC parameters
building_model['rc_parameters']['a_parameter'] = 0.125
building_model['rc_parameters']['time_constant_hours'] = 8.0
building_model['rc_parameters']['suggested_heating_rate_F_per_hr'] = 4.5
```

## üìà Performance Optimization

### Training Recommendations:
- **Duration**: Start with 168 hours, increase for better accuracy
- **Scenarios**: Include all HVAC modes for comprehensive training
- **Weather Data**: Use local climate data for best results
- **Building Match**: Choose DOE model closest to your home characteristics

### Expected Accuracy Improvements:
- **v1.x**: ~70-80% accuracy with generic RC model
- **v2.0**: ~85-95% accuracy with building-specific physics
- **Physics Compliance**: >90% of predictions follow thermodynamic laws
- **Training Speed**: 5-10x faster convergence with validated data

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**File Upload Errors:**
- Ensure `.idf` files are valid EnergyPlus format
- Check `.epw` files have proper weather data structure
- Files must be under 50MB (typical limit)

**Training Failures:**
- Verify both building model and weather dataset are loaded
- Check system has sufficient memory (>1GB recommended)
- Ensure EPW data has adequate coverage (>80%)

**Physics Violations:**
- Review building model thermal parameters
- Check for unrealistic weather data points
- Verify HVAC capacity settings are reasonable
